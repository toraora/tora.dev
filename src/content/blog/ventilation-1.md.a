We've probably all heard somewhere or another that breathing air containing a high concentration of CO2 is unsafe or affects our cognitive abilities. This post details an amateur's attempt to uncover some of the theory behind keeping our living spaces well-ventilated. 

## What's a safe amount of CO2?

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently around 420 ppm and is increasing at approximately 2 ppm per year.

A good place to start is the occupational safety threshold set by the CDC, which permits a time-weighted average exposure of 5,000 ppm for 10 hours and a higher limit of 30,000 ppm for 15 minutes[^1]. Worth noting is that these thresholds have decreased over time in light of more research on the subject, suggesting that what would be considered an acceptable level of CO2 exposure might be even lower in the future.

We'd of course like to do better than that for our homes and especially schools, where unsafe amounts of CO2 and other pollutants would affect people when their bodies and cognitive abilities are still developing. Studies show moderate reductions in cognition even at levels as low as 1,000 ppm, reaching severely diminished performance in some aspects at 2,500 ppm[^2].

Given that, and also because it's a nice number, the remainder of this series on ventilation will target 1,000 ppm as the upper bound for safe long-term inhalation.
